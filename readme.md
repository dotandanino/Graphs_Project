# project information:
- in this project i had implemnted class of undirected graph and also the next algorithms:
    - BFS
    - DFS
    - dijkstra
    - prim
    - kruskal
- there is three ways to run this project you can run the main or the test or to run valgrind on both of then.
    #### run main
    - to run main you need to write the next commands:
        - make main
        - ./main
    #### run test
    - to run test you need to write the next commands:
        - make test
    #### run valgrind
    - to run valgrind you need to write the next commands:
        - make valgrind
